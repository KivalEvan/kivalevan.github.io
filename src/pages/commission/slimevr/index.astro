            SlimeVR is a set of open-sourced product to facilitate full-body
            tracking for VR that works for any SteamVR device such as HTC Vive,
            Valve Index, WMR, and Oculus Link. No base station is required, and
            uses wireless configuration that can be connected via local network
            on router or PC Wi-Fi connection.

                This section is a recap of things said in <a
                    href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/"
                    >SlimeVR Docs

                </a>. Once you get your hands on SlimeVR Tracker, head over onto <a
                    href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/slimevr-setup.html"
                    >SlimeVR Setup
                </a> to get started.
            </p>
            <p></p><h5>Pre-requisite:</h5>
            <ul class="list-arrow">
                <li>SteamVR supported VR device</li>
                <li>Good Wi-Fi connection with local network to PC</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                First step is to download and run <a
                    href="https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Installer/releases/latest/download/slimevr_web_installer.exe"
                    >SlimeVR Installer
                </a> and turn on SlimeVR tracker and see if they are blinking 2-3
                times, if not try charging it first. Before wearing the tracker,
                let the tracker lay flat untouched for 1-2min to allow for calibration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Micro-USB port is used to communicate with the tracker, which
                are used to enter Wi-fi credentials to allow SlimeVR Server to
                find and communicate with the tracker. Make sure to turn off the
                tracker before proceeding this step.
            </p>
            <p>
                USB-C port is used to charge the tracker, it is highly-advised
                to turn off the tracker before charging to prolong the battery
                life and to not damage the component.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the tracker is tracked by the SlimeVR Server, set the
                tracker to corresponding role and set your body proportion in
                given settings. Visit <a
                    href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/slimevr-setup.html#configure-proportions-and-trackers"
                    >SlimeVR Setup
                </a> for more information. Setting up body proportion may take time
                and may not work well for different user, visit <a
                    href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/body-config.html"
                    >SlimeVR Body Configuration
                </a> to learn more.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is highly recommended that you use <a
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1009850/OVR_Advanced_Settings/"
                    >OVR Advanced Settings
                </a>
                to allow easy click calibration reset as MPU6500 tends to drift significantly
                after every 10-15min; follow <a
                    href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/slimevr-setup.html#ovr-advanced-settings-bindings"

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>ADVANCED USER:</strong> if you are familiar with Arduino
                and want more control, the process is more or less the same; follow
                <a href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/upload-firmware-guide.html"

                The tracker uses schematic provided by <a
                    href="https://docs.slimevr.dev/tracker-schematics.html"
                    >SlimeVR Docs
                </a> using MPU6500 for IMU and all the optional features. The product
                is a DIY project assembled together with individual component encased
                in custom-made 3D printed case model heavily-inspired by ~Red~#4028
                case design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The full-body tracking requires minimum of 5 SlimeVR Tracker to
                properly track body and leg movement. It is possible to use only
                one at a time but may not be feasible. Primary Tracker can be
                extended with Auxiliary Tracker to allow chest for better
                leaning tracking and feet for feet rotation tracking.
                Optionally, another tracker can be used on hip to further
                improve body tracking. Do note the more tracker means you will
                spend more time setup and strap to your body.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tracker casing colour can be customised with black, silver,
                white, translucent, red, green, and blue. Additionally, the
                cover colour can also be customised. Customisability only
                applies to all item within set and cannot be set individually.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tracker has 38mm width strap hole allowing easy insert and
                swapping, and wide width for better stability. It is recommended
                to use around 30-40cm for leg part and 90cm for body part,
                depending on your body proportion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tracker is pre-flashed with the SlimeVR firmware and set for
                orientation per each tracker, it can be updated via OTA or
                Micro-USB. Furthermore, the user is allowed to modify the
                firmware to their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to supply shortage and increasing price of BNO08x, the
                significantly better IMU than MPU6500, the model only uses
                MPU6500 which are both the cheapes
                <td>Hip Auxiliary Tracker</td>t and easy to get with downside of
                substantial tracking drift. At normal BNO08x price, the tracker
                would be about 2x the price for a set here.

            <dl>
                <dt>
                    The tracker is on but it is not connected to SlimeVR Server.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Connect your tracker via Micro-USB port and enter Wi-Fi
                    credential via SlimeVR Server, then please wait for a short
                    moment before it is connected. Ensure the tracker has
                    connected to Wi-Fi by the message log or tracker blinked
                    only once or twice. If the problem still persist, check your
                    local area network to ensure both SlimeVR Tracker and PC are
                    on the same line and restart SlimeVR Server.
                </dd>

                <dt>The tracker looks jittery/laggy.</dt>
                <dd>
                    Check the latency of the tracker on SlimeVR server. For
                    optimal performance, the latency has to be below 10ms for
                    smoother result. This issue is significantly apparent for
                    tracker with extension, try disconnecting the extension if
                    problem still persist.
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    The tracker keeps on rotating even if I'm not doing
                    anything.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    This is due to the tracker calibrating it's rotation. You
                    must always leave it lay flat before wearing them for
                    1-2min. If you accidentally turn off the tracker, you may
                    have to do this process again.
                </dd>

                <dt>The tracker doesn't properly capture the motion.</dt>
                <dd>
                    Set the tracker role accordingly in SlimeVR Server. If the
                    tracker is facing forward or in front of you, then it should
                    be set to forward; side would be left/right. Then, set the
                    body configuration according to your body proportion. You
                    can manually set it or use Autobone. Be sure to adjust the
                    tracker as to stay in place firmly.
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    The tracker tracked almost close to movement but not as
                    accurate.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    This is unfortunately the limitation of the technology
                    behind the tracker. It can only imitate your motion solely
                    from rotation data and skeleton model. However, it is
                    possible to get 1:1 tracking if you spend enough time
                    tweaking the configuration and tracker placement.
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    The tracker seemingly rotate away further than it was
                    originally.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    This is also unfortunately an issue with cheap IMU used in
                    the tracker. If you encounter this, reset or quick reset to
                    snap it back into place. To make life easier, use OVR
                    Advanced Settings for a hotkey on reset.
